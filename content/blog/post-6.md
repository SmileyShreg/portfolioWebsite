Metal textures , grid , cement ,light caught my attention. Started reading about Brutalism as a Design Philosophy. It led me to understand why a certain period government buildings look a bare minimum stone , cement , line structure. That led me to knowing about Designer Le Corbusier. How the first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru called Le Corbusier to set foundation for a new story. It was a period of rise Industrialization and Manufacturing. It was the time of showing , cherishing just bare material and the technology which they newly developed to manufacture abundantly.All these stories influenced my work. It was the time of my life where i was seeking something real . That mind of mine didnt see pleasure in aesthetic much. The works from 2019 to 2021 were infludenced by these philosophies.

Made real products as well as rendered them using Blender and other 3D softwares.

If you had time to see them , can visit this google drive folder I made.
